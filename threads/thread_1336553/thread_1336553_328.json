/>\r\n​​本文发布时，石原监督所负责的剧场版《升上二年级的久美子们》还未正式命名，现本剧场版已正式命名为《吹响！上低音号~誓言的终曲~》，将于2019年4月19日上映，特此说明。<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n续作——两部《上低音号》<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n——请问《吹响！上低音号》（以下略称《上低音号》）系列的新作将会是怎样的呢？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：《升上二年级的久美子们》就如其名，是关于久美子们升入二年级后的故事。本次将制作两部新剧场版，为了以示区别，也称之为《久美子二年级篇》。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：如果只叫《二年级篇》的话，可能会有观众误认为讲的是“优子她们的故事”，于是我们在标题限定了“久美子”。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：所以是《久美子二年级篇》而不是《二年级篇》呢。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：前不久武田绫乃老师发售了新小说，故事核心是“久美子二年级篇”，同时也讲述了升上三年级的霙和希美的故事，而后者则是我担任监督的《利兹与青鸟》所对应的情节。《利兹与青鸟》的主人公是霙和希美，而久美子们则变成了两人光芒之下的普通吹奏乐部部员，这个视角可能会带来一些新鲜感。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：虽然两部剧场版的原作都是《吹响！上低音号》，但是监督并不一样，因而会展现出完全不同的模样。《久美子二年级篇》讲述的是久美子升上二年级，在新生入部后所面对的各种各样的困难，我个人认为是一部很积极向上的作品。相比之下，《利兹与青鸟》恐怕是一部沉静阴郁的作品。是这样吗，山田监督？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：我想《利兹与青鸟》是介于《剧场版 吹响！上低音号~想要传达的旋律~》与《久美子二年级篇》这两个热情故事之间的清新故事。巧的是，它公开的时期亦是在上述两部作品之间。只看标题可能确实有种阴郁的感觉，但我认为作品本身……是尽可能想要突出“清新感”。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：以前（70-80年代）的TV动画，播放时间短则半年，长则数年，即使有着很繁复的设定也有其发挥的空间。但是，近来都是像《上低音号》这样只有一个季度（全集12~13话）的作品……TV动画《上低音号》也被赋予了很多设定，作为制作人员，我是非常感激仍有机会让这些设定再次派上用场的。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：Staff们长期参与作品的制作，对角色逐渐变得熟悉起来，因此也容易倾注自己的爱。这大概不是“一期一会”。当Staff们已经熟知了这些角色、有了眷恋，项目的很多方面才能够顺利进展。从制作方面来说，作画虽然是以“班”为单位负责不同的话数、轮流完成13话，大家与很多角色却也只能相逢一次，很是寂寞。因此，作品能够延续下去是非常令人开心的。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：话虽如此，档期太长大概也会很辛苦吧（笑）。在长篇作品中，有的Staff对作品和角色非常了解，有时能够创作出奇迹般的内容，这是非常有趣的一点。我认为只要作品能继续下去，能够发挥的空间也会随之增加。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n——听说读过原作后，石原监督和山田监督眼睛都湿润了……<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：不光是湿润，都哭出来了。当时为了准备脚本会议，我事先拜读了原作，然后在桌前静静地哭了出来。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：我从原作者老师那里接手这个项目的时候，就已经……<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：为什么如此揪心呢？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：大概是拜读的时候有一瞬间将自己代入……切身感受到了吧。或者说，自己那份一直小心翼翼藏着的、不愿为人所知的软弱被戳中了吧……当我完成这部作品的时候，我感觉到有某种重要之物正在拼命挣扎、喷涌而出。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：最初得知这个企划的时候，我就觉得《利兹与青鸟》很适合山田监督。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：是吗？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：你是想做的吧？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：是想做的。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：不只是因为作品本身很有趣，更因为它有动人心扉的内容吧。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：应该说有着属于少女的残酷之美吧……我非常庆幸本作品在试图描绘这样的内容。我想充分拍出霙和希美在那个年纪的多愁善感，连她们的一声叹息也不错过。我渴望沉浸于对少女的纪实中！我想要心无旁骛地拍摄只属于这个年纪的她们的身姿。一边烦恼一边成长着的女孩子，真的非常耀眼啊。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n作品的创作寻求“跳出边框”<br />\r\n​<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n——请问在制作中有什么讲究，或者该注意的地方吗？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：我担心这个系列长期做下去后，以至于角色会变得“符号化”，我想避免变成这样。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：但要实际做到也很难啊。比如，就算某个负责的Staff及时停下了，许多其他的Staff也可能会把控不住力度，让角色进一步“符号化”。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：还有，即使监督对角色的形象有一个把握，在实际表现中哪怕有一次改变了角色形象，这就会成为“前例”，那么就不能再次把形象修补成原本的样子了。这一点在《巴加的工作室》这部作品中也有提到。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n感谢祭OVA《巴加的工作室》感谢祭OVA《巴加的工作室》<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：是的。“必须提前设定好形象”，这个规则本来是为了保持作品角色形象的连贯性而制定的，但一旦变成石原监督说的那样，我觉得规则反而会限制作品的发挥吧。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：不过山田监督通常给人以“很重视角色形象”的印象呢。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：啊，那真是太好了……最近我有点担惊受怕的……<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：是这样吗？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：刚才石原监督夸我“很重视角色形象”，我担心那会不会是维护自己自尊一样的坚持。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：啊……我也有这么想过来着。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：抱歉说了这种强加于人的事——刚才真让人难为情呢（笑）。我认为作品的制作需要许多的“试错”和 “深信不疑的主观意见”，不然会完全停滞不前……但是，有时进一步了解了本质，反而无法大胆出手了吧？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：比如？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：比如，即使解开了数学题，我也不想知道具体的答案，而是想享受途中推演时的“试错”过程：“不是这样，也不是那样”。等终于解出答案，发现自己搞错了——我喜欢这种瞬间。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：原来如此。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：对于作品的创作，“深信不疑的主观意见”是活力的来源，如果缺乏这一点的话……创作者就会迷失方向。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：这就是你为什么担惊受怕的原因？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：是的（笑）。对于单独的某次表现来说是这样，但我认为艺术创作常常需要“跳出边框”，比如说，如果作为创作前沿的监督变成了有“自主意识”的活人……<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：嗯。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：因为没有约束和局限，就很容易切中肯綮。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：啊，的确是。这是非常好的例子啊。不仅限于动画，对于所有作品的创作大概都是这样吧。我认为只有当创作者想要表现本心、把本心嵌入作品当中，作品才能变得吸引人。换言之，如果只是顺着习惯机械创作出来的东西，很无趣。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：是的。我认为当一个人有勇气去表现本心、“挣脱”外在约束时，只要他努力的话……大概就能成为“创作者”了吧。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：我感觉山田监督的作品，全部都嵌入了自己的主观意识呢。我认为就是这些构成了“山田的色彩”吧。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n关于今后的《上低音号》<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n——请问两部新作的看点在哪里？<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：我想说，是荧幕上的全部（笑）！至今一直在观看《上低音号》系列的观众们，想必已经知道这部作品的看点了，我认为继续关注那些地方就可以了。对于还没有观看的观众……这么说吧。我认为人有一种“想要提高自己技艺”的渴望。参加社团活动是否会有回报、将来是否能成为职业演奏家？即使这些都尚不清楚，为了精湛技艺，主人公们依然会团结一心、拼命努力、挑战自我的极限，我希望观众们能够欣赏这样活跃着的她们。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：本作应该还集中描绘了面对事事无法顺利进展时的那份着急感、心疼感。嗯……然后，我想本作会率直地描绘霙和希美两人如何正视彼此心结的事情。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n——那么，最后请对粉丝们说几句话吧。 <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n石原：我想应该会有观众一直翘首以待吧，《久美子二年级篇》描绘了久美子她们后来发生的故事，其中会遇到困难，但请务必观赏久美子们在困难之中的种种努力。<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n山田：《利兹与青鸟》是试图以少女们为焦点而制作的一部作品，我自身非常期待。我希望能够做出与期待相应的作品，如果各位能够观看，我不胜荣幸。<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br

14:54","message":"ANN Review<br />\r\nby Nick Creamer, Nov 5th 2018<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLiz and the Blue Bird<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSynopsis:<br />\r\nBack in middle school, Nozomi Kasaki came up to the shy Mizore Yoroizuka with an unexpected question: “would you like to join the concert band?” That idle question led to Mizore's first experience of true happiness, as Nozomi became her first and dearest friend. But after Nozomi abandoned her during her first year at Kitauji High School, Mizore fell into depression, only regaining her spirit when her friend returned many months later. Now in their final year of high school, Mizore will have to come to terms with the end of high school, as she and Nozomi perform “Liz and the Blue Bird” together. Mizore is far from ready to say goodbye, but just as Liz herself came to realize, you must set the caged bird free.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nReview:<br />\r\n&nbsp;  <br />\r\nLiz and the Blue Bird is a film centered around two stories: the actual fable of Liz and the Blue Bird, and the story of two girls assigned as its soloists for the Kitauji Concert Band. These girls, Mizore and Nozomi, featured prominently in the first half of Sound! Euphonium's second season. That half essentially centered on Nozomi's desire to return to concert band after a year away, and how her potential turn prompted a great deal of emotional trauma for Mizore. Here, a year after the events of Euphonium 2, the melodramatic stakes of the series proper are all but forgotten. Our heroes are a year older and a year wiser, but more than that, this is a film from Mizore's own perspective. And Mizore's mind is a quiet, anxious, and profoundly delicate place.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLiz director Naoko Yamada has built a career defined by delicacy, from her breakout hit K-ON! through her recent transition into feature films. Across films like Tamako Love Story and A Silent Voice, she has defined a clear and consistent vocabulary of drama, always focusing on the quiet, the unseen, the little movements and subtle expression shifts that reveal all that our words can't express. Yamada has frankly been a master dramatist ever since her first feature, and in Liz and the Blue Bird, she may well have reached a new peak. I can confidently say that Liz is one of the most beautiful works of art I've experienced in years, and a film I will be returning to for many years to come.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLiz's two narratives parallel each other completely, but the actual Blue Bird fable is the film's framing device. In that story, a girl named Liz lives alone in the forest, where she tends to animals and enjoys a peaceful but lonely life. One day, a strange girl dressed all in blue appears, bringing love and light to Liz's quiet world. But as time goes on, Liz realizes that this girl is actually a blue bird, and though she yearns to hold on to her, she knows her friend deserves to be free. And so Liz releases the bird from its cage, sacrificing her own happiness to ensure her friend can fly.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe parallels between the Blue Bird narrative and Mizore's own story are clear from early on in the film, but are revealed more through narratives of personal space and perspective than overt dramatic beats. The story opens with a statement of purpose that seems to embody Yamada's career in miniature, as we follow Mizore on her way to school. Stopping outside the gate, Mizore hesitates, and the film pauses with her. A quiet tinkling of piano keys and dashes of percussion trail off in the background, like a band tuning before play. Mizore sits on the steps, waiting for something we can't see. Then, as the piano melody snaps into sync with emerging footsteps, Mizore turns, and sees Nozomi approaching. Matching Mizore's tight-fisted shuffle, we follow Mizore and Nozomi through a nigh-wordless ten minute sequence, as her feelings bloom through their quiet walk to the practice hall.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAll of Liz's manifold strengths are clear in that opening sequence, Mizore's emotions coming through clearly even though she barely speaks a word. Part of this comes down to the film's incredibly careful animation, and soft, expressive character designs. The thick linework and exaggerated hair styles of Euphonium are gone here - instead, the film is expressed through delicate lines echoing designer Futoshi Nishiya's prior collaboration on A Silent Voice, and character art that impresses not through its eye-catching profiles, but its subtly of form. This linework is beautiful in Liz's real-world segments, but even more necessary for the segments that dip into the Blue Bird fantasy. There, Mizore's feelings are expressed through gorgeous watercolors and soft pastels that echo Violet Evergarden, Ghibli vistas, and humble works of impressionism. Mizore may be a quiet and shy person, but our journey into her head perfectly captures her creativity and passion, the vitality of her personal world.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIt's not just the visual design that makes this segment sing, though. As the two girls march one after the other through the school, Mizore's feelings are also captured in Liz's sound design, gentle crests and falls of piano matching her preoccupation with Nozomi's figure. As her eyes catch on Nozomi's lightly bouncing ponytail and confidently swinging arms, the piano shifts to match the tempo of Nozomi's movements. Mizore's memories of walking this same route as an adolescent are buoyed by somber strings, and when they reach the practice room, piano dissolves into a patter of percussion, as if Mizore is actively working to suppress her feelings. We don't need to be told Mizore loves Nozomi; why else would the melody of her life sync to Nozomi's footsteps, the tempo of her day fit the rise and fall of Nozomi's presence? The desperate passion Mizore feels for her friend is made more clear in those first ten, nearly wordless moments than some romances manage in their entire running time.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAs I've described it, that opening sequence might sound like some unique tour-de-force of environmental storytelling, but Liz maintains that level of subtlety and emotive delivery across its every twist and turn. It's become a bit of a cliche to mention Yamada's preoccupation with hands and feet, but those priorities aren't just a “style quirk.” Across delicate shots of partial bodies and scenes framed to leave enough space for both characters and their thoughts, Yamada conveys the lived experience of anxiety, desperate love, and sorrow through terms far more universal than words. There are scenes in this film that felt as paralyzingly tense as a horror film, Yamada's mastery of tone conjuring moments of anxiety and self-loathing almost too sharp to bear. The hollow halls of Kitauji and quiet spaces Mizore finds for herself speak volumes; her half-glances, consistent tugging at her hair, and subtle shifts of posture reveal all the vibrant colors of her love.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe overt narrative of Liz and the Blue Bird is fairly minimalist, leaving as much room as possible for Yamada's delicate exploration of key emotional moments. In the midst of their final year, Mizore and Nozomi are both practicing for an upcoming performance, where they'll actually be performing Liz as the flute and oboe soloists. Unfortunately, their practices find them consistently out of sync, and Mizore blames herself for this. Terrified of the end of high school, and of seeing her one precious friend abandon her, Mizore identifies deeply with Liz's character, but could never imagine actually setting the blue bird free. Without Nozomi, she is nothing - and in her desperation to hold onto Nozomi, she is unable to either engage with her future or truly communicate with her friend.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMizore is the perfect heroine for a Yamada film, so preoccupied with the past, so unable to convey her feelings in any way but physically. Her worldview allows us to peer into a Kitauji utterly unlike the world of Sound! Euphonium, where the awkward fumblings of Kumiko and the dynamics of the group as a whole just sort of fade into the distance. Mizore's life is defined by Nozomi's movements, a fact that stands at the heart of Liz's drama, and also defines its aesthetic scope. Flutes and pianos soar in momentary triumph when Nozomi enters her view; when she leaves, violins signal doubt and fatigue, fingers clenching in buried grief.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nUltimately, Liz and the Blue Bird's focus expands to encompass Nozomi's worldview as well, leading into a final act where their various misunderstandings end up speaking to their mutual concern. While Mizore remains painfully shy, Nozomi's brightness is eventually shown to be its own mask, and Liz succeeds just as well in conveying idle yet barbed dialogue as it does in capturing wordless emotions. In the end, simply talking through their feelings with trusted friends helps each of them come to a happier relationship with the Blue Bird narrative, leading to a triumphant performance that rings out with all the vitality Mizore had locked inside. When the bird is set free, it dances in flight with such beauty that I couldn't choose whether to marvel at KyoAni's beautiful animation, or close my eyes entirely and let the music take hold. Liz isn't a work of pure nostalgic longing; it is simultaneously a paean to our past selves and a celebration of all we might become, a work that tempers the pain of youth with assurance that though change will come, true feelings endure.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIf you're expecting a conventional sequel to the Sound! Euphonium television series, you won't find it in Liz and the Blue Bird. This is a very different kind of story, few of the Euphonium stars have particularly prominent roles, and Yamada was clearly more concerned with making a highly personal tone piece than an ensemble drama. But if you have any appreciation for Yamada's work, or for slow, quiet, and heartfelt stories in general, I strongly urge you to give this film a shot. From its gorgeously painted fantasy vignettes to its subtly devastating personal moments, from its utterly cohesive visual aesthetic to its rich and ever-fitting sound design, Liz and the Blue Bird is an absolute triumph. Yamada has created a masterpiece. We are so very lucky to receive it.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nGrade:<br />\r\nOverall : A+<br />\r\nStory : A<br />\r\nAnimation : A<br />\r\nArt : A+<br />\r\nMusic : A++<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n+ An indescribably beautiful and perfectly cohesive drama about the difficulty of love, change, and communication. Features the best sound design of any property I've seen in years.<br />\r\n− Likely too slow and low-stakes of a story for many viewers' tastes, and may disappoint those hoping for a direct Euphonium follow-up.","anonymous":"0","attachment":"0","status":"0","replycredit":"0","position":"10114","username":"xwr","adminid":"0","groupid":"57","memberstatus":"0","number":"9822","dbdateline":"1541746483","groupiconid":"12"},{"pid":"41546094","tid":"1336553","first":"0","author":"xwr","authorid":"179647","dateline":"2018-11-10
