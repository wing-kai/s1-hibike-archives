Euphonium Interview: Jukki Hanada (translated)</strong><br />\r\nThis is the second of a series of interviews with various staff members of Sound! Euphonium that was published in the Official Fanbook released by Takarajimasha on September 23.<br />\r\nSeries Composer:Jukki Hanada<br />\r\nScriptwriter. Notable works include Beyond the Boundary, Love, Chuunibyou, &amp; Other Delusions, and Steins;Gate (series composer for all).<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>A scenario packed with the atmosphere of a concert band</strong><br />\r\n<strong>– What impressions did you have after first reading the novel?</strong><br />\r\nIt was a very entertaining read. I was completely absorbed into the story as I read, especially with the power behind the last part with the showoff between Reina and Kaori for the solo. As I took notes for the scenario, I wondered if we would be casting too big a net with the number of characters we have for only 13 episodes, considering the number of people in a band is so huge. How we would narrow down our depiction of which characters was something I was aware of from the very beginning. In a novel, you aren’t concerned with characters that are around the protagonist if you don’t write about them, but you’ll see them in an anime.<br />\r\n<strong>– Did Director (Tatsuya) Ishihara give you any requests concerning how the scenario would go?</strong><br />\r\nIshihara-san thought about thoroughly depicting the story of the first volume so that we could put it into 13 episodes. Generally, when novels get animated, there’s a lot of works that put the content of 2-4 books into 1 cour (12-14 episodes), but with one book, we had to insert elements between scenes to thoroughly depict it. Even if I felt the other way was easier, I would have to stop that in order to meet what Ishihara-san wanted for the composition.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/eupho0001.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– What did you concentrate on while thinking about creating the series composition?</strong><br />\r\nWell, the peak of the novel was during the re-audition between Reina and Kaori, so how would we set things in motion to arrive at that point? Also, I proposed how we would depict the final part of Kumiko’s plot. The anime would arrive at a temporary final episode through a different path, so I wanted a different arrival and climax for her. Thus, while I was creating the episode structure, I kept in mind that the 12th episode would be Kumiko’s turning point. From the very start, Ishihara-san was fixated on having the final episode’s B-part contain the final performance scene. Since they are part of this work’s very nature and that there was an extraordinarily large emphasis on performances, I was very aware of when I could insert them in the **ning stages of the composition.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– I was curious: what considerations did you have in mind to change the distance between characters as the story progressed?</strong><br />\r\nI wanted that sense of moving forward step by step that you get when making a TV anime sometimes. For example, episode 8 holds the summit of Kumiko and Reina’s relationship, so how do I shorten that distance between them as I move to that point? Though the point at the start of episode 2 isn’t in the novel, perhaps I could insert that exchange so viewers will be aware of how far apart they are…. However, I had to stay alert and make allowances here and there so that I don’t overdo it and ruin the novel’s merits. From where we reach the summit for their relationship, I then surged into the novel’s peak of the re-audition and furthermore into Kumiko’s climax point. It’s a bit rough, but you get how that feels.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/euphobd17.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– What do you keep in mind when adding portions that were not in the novel?</strong><br />\r\nI try to use my imagination as necessary while keeping the contents of the novel in mind. Hazuki is a beginner and she has a wild personality, so perhaps including an episode where she buys the wrong mouthpiece would be appropriate. Sapphire is really self-conscious about her name, so her having to correct Asuka-senpai every time she calls her “Sapphire” would fit. (laughs) As work progresses, my understanding of the characters grow, so I can strongly move them around with my own hand, not worrying so much about the logic. I personally like the president, Haruka, a lot, but unfortunately, she doesn’t have many appearances in the latter half of the novel. (laughs) So when I would write her lines for that part, I used a certain kind of image of her that I had in mind as she speaks. Also the conversation with Asuka and her before the re-audition felt like it came out so spontaneously.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Were there any orders from Director Ishihara relating to each episode’s scenario?</strong><br />\r\nActually, there weren’t any at all. From the very beginning, he told me ”please write this as freely as you want.” To start I had to figure out what kind of work this was and to put it in a crude state. Using that as a chopping board, we would boil down the contents during discussions with everyone saying “would this character do such a thing?” or “this scene is surprisingly important, isn’t it?”<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Besides the performance scenes, what elements did you include to make the show seem more like a concert band?</strong><br />\r\nWhen I went to observe a concert band, their practicing imagery was something that remained with me. Elements like instruction given to members and how those members responded are portions people don’t see on the stage. That experienced feeling of tension and the sudden rush of sounds pitter-pattering in like a mosaic inside the room is truly unique. Both Ishihara-san and Yamada-san, who I went with to see the band, gave me an order that “[we] want to insert scenes around practicing as much as possible.”<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/euphobd18.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– What points in particular did you see while you were observing the band?</strong><br />\r\nWe observed high school and collegiate concert bands and a concert performance. At the start of our observation, the students were performing the “Crescent Moon Dance” piece and we were also able to see them practicing it as well. There were many instances where the instructor would say “play this song like this” and while the students listened to their ex**ation, they would know what to do to make the song sound like what the instructor wanted. (laughs) It’s so much of a positive to see the song being plated and understand how to play that song. I was scribbling notes for what Taki-sensei would say as we were observing them. (laughs) Additionally, the specific phrases the instructor used were memorable. “A bit more stingy” or “More cool.” Someone who’s new to playing instruments wouldn’t know what they’re saying, but it’d be properly communicated to someone who’s played a lot. Also, this is something people may not remember, but try to think back to when you listened to a concert band when you were a student. The tune doesn’t suddenly stop after 2 stanzas, right? At that time, what part is the band practicing? When I listened and heard that in reality, it immediately intrigued me, so I thought it would be great to try and skillfully add that to the scenario. There’s a lot of modern anime shows that have depictions which suddenly float away from you, but this work feels like you thoroughly depict everything about it.<br />\r\nA youthful drama reflecting student hierarchical relationships<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– One of the side aspects of this work was adolescence. What did you have in mind to depict that side of it?</strong><br />\r\nFor us, there doesn’t appear to be any difference between first, second, or third years in high school. But looking back at that time, there was a huge difference that a single year makes. You act like a first year would when you are one and you start to act like a second year when you become one. I remained aware of things like the difference between Reina’s immature conduct and Kaori’s more adult attitude and their subtle differences despite being students in the same decade. At the time I wrote Gotou saying “You’re a first year. Don’t worry about it,” I was thinking I would say the same thing when I was in his position. (laughs) It’s also a bit easy to use club activities as a spot to show the entertaining ups and downs of a scripted drama.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Kumiko is a bit disconnected from what you would imagine a protagonist to look like. What issues did you have while you were writing her?</strong><br />\r\nI’m a similar person to her, so it never felt difficult at all. I’d just write myself as a base and then it would become Kumiko’s lines. (laughs) Can I depict all of the flaws that Kumiko has…. She says just a bit too much, she’s like a cold splash of water on everyone else burning around her, and while she says some profound things, she’s not profound herself. If they aren’t recognized, then Kumiko should be seen as detestable, but it’s not like that at all. Everyone in the staff and cast shared that “Kumiko component” and worked towards the same direction to depict her well.<br />\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/euphobd19.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– What impressions remain with you of the depictions of the other characters?</strong><br />\r\nPerhaps the character who changed the most from the novel is Sapphire. Everyone in the novel (except Kumiko) spoke with the Kansaiben dialect, but Sapphire used it in the most lively and chattery ways. When I changed it to standard Japanese, she became this ordinary character. So then we had to change her tone a bit. After that, as I added Yamada-san’s idea that she “loves rock,” Sapphire became this entertaining character. From the beginning when she says “I’ll risk my life on it,” and nothing else, Sapphire became this necessary character.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>– Now that you’ve seen the completed visuals, what scenes remain impressive for you?</strong><br />\r\nIt’s gotta be the last scene in episode 12 where Taki-sensei confesses to Kumiko “I haven’t forgotten that you said you can do it.” Actually, at the scenario stage, it was “I still truly believe we will go to Nationals,” just like it was in the novel. That was what episode director (Ichirou) Miyoshi-san changed it to in the storyboards and it became this truly impressive line. As a screenwriter, I feel like “I lost!” (laughs)<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/eupho0002.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Please give us your final thoughts after participating in this work.</strong><br />\r\nThis was something truly worth doing. I can say that it’s one of my most notable works. Before this work, I put it as a standard and felt my next work would be indexed according to it. If our fans would continue to forever love this show and watch it again while recommending it, it would greatly please me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n","anonymous":"0","attachment":"0","status":"0","replycredit":"0","position":"13038","username":"心之渊","adminid":"0","groupid":"57","memberstatus":"0","number":"12571","dbdateline":"1443535134","groupiconid":"12"},{"pid":"30305171","tid":"1085129","first":"0","author":"结标淡希","authorid":"178337","dateline":"2015-9-29 22:07","message":"<div class=\"reply_wrap\"><a href=\"https://bbs.saraba1st.com/2b/forum.php?mod=redirect&amp;goto=findpost&amp;pid=30305090&amp;ptid=1085129\"><font color=\"#999999\">心之渊 发表于 2015-9-29 21:58</font></a><br />\r\n23号发行的fanbook之前有流出作者炸裂级的对谈内容<br />\r\n有老外翻译了其中花田的石原的访谈，英文应该会比较好懂 ...</div><br />\n<img src=\"https://static.saraba1st.com/image/smiley/face/11.gif\" />","anonymous":"0","attachment":"0","status":"0","replycredit":"0","position":"13039","username":"结标淡希","adminid":"0","groupid":"54","memberstatus":"0","number":"12572","dbdateline":"1443535651","groupiconid":"13"},{"pid":"30305337","tid":"1085129","first":"0","author":"心之渊","authorid":"219246","dateline":"2015-9-29 22:30","message":"<font style=\"color:rgb(45, 100, 179)\"><a href=\"http://jump.bdimg.com/safecheck/index?url=rN3wPs8te/pG/gmAWiJ6wPuRY8eS695t0Z8Xv/nlZBffB+hZG2dSsWLPAUs00Zcm86RSuWaT+2GVbkgm1kcuW5i4PILzpPfBQmqVFVfGegVlZT6+jYxFiUwPzFkuk4Ii5K2VAHKQDJc28RzENfJv4KRZLWfj/MxXX0zh0D4Job3RyRHW79lAWOOATXnJvdNVF0m7zmg/3KGWoSp+Dg5xp/Wo5ppDuX+/HdJWvVeJDIv4PSaVq54cV8TK2mXBwclKIPmnw7rujmeQ2GiqVKH5PYtbA++P0X75PRSTvptcZbrI9lWblkPrS/VzSI7NL7ug0P/3tRohCXjQqorLBfht+3Y9qHh6BM0y\">https://ultimatemegax.wordpress.com/2015/09/27/sound-euphonium-roundtable-director-tatsuya-ishihara-series-director-naoko-yamada-author-ayano-takeda/</a></font><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n这一篇是石原、山田和原作者的<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Sound! Euphonium Roundtable: Director Tatsuya Ishihara, Series Director Naoko Yamada, &amp; Author Ayano Takeda</strong><br />\r\nThis is a translation of the (long) roundtable discussion between Director Ishihara, Series Director Yamada, and Author Takeda that was published in the Sound! Euphonium Official Fanbook (published on September 25, 2015 by Takarajimasha). Thanks to @yuyucow, @tadamari, and @animenewsdotbiz for their comments and reviews.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Director x Series Director x Author Roundtable</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Director:</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Tatsuya Ishihara</strong><br />\r\nAnime director at Kyoto Animation. Previous works directed include Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai!, Nichijou, and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.<br />\r\n<strong>Series Director:</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Naoko Yamada</strong><br />\r\nAnime director/animator at Kyoto Animation. Previous works directed include K-On!, Tamako Market, and the award-winning Tamako Love Story.<br />\r\n<strong>Author:</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ayano Takeda</strong><br />\r\nAuthor. Debuted with “Today, We Breathed Together” in 2013. Also in 2013, Sound! Euphonium was published; currently there are 3 volumes and a collection of shorts published.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>It’s rare to see an ordinary protagonist among anime characters</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Director Ishihara and Yamada-san, what were your thoughts when you first read the novel?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara:</strong> Actually, there had been discussions at a “talking about it” level about wanting to produce a work that was set in Kyoto by people inside our company. With the setting near our company, my true first impression was that I wanted to animate this more and more. (laughs) Also, since I always think about how I would animate something when I read it, I pondered how we would animate the SunFest parade. (laughs) For animation, we would have to animate a lot of people walking and holding instruments. It’d burn a lot of calories watching it.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>My first impression was that the atmosphere felt right somehow. It was depicted lively with lots of adolescent palpitations and breaths, so I was immensely hooked. I thought that it would be good to depict anything where people get fired up and that you could sympathize with the ongoing relationships with the people taking part in it, not just the concert band itself.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Takeda-sensei, what were your impressions about your work being made into an anime?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>At first I had no idea what that meant. (laughs) It didn’t mean that it was a hit, so I wasn’t that startled. Honestly, when I met with the staff for our meeting, we would just talk about various topics.<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>Rather than feeling like it was a business meeting, we had random discussions that made it feel more like an introduction. After that, it was more like steadily creating the setting for the anime for us, but what did it feel like to you, Takeda-sensei?<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda:</strong> It felt like I was talking about my whole family. At first, I was just passing on information about the characters as well as the minor characters, but after a while, I started to steadily pass on settings for the story that I would write. After it was decided to make the novel into an anime, I believe I took some of our talks and put that in the two volumes published afterwards. (laughs)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screenshot_2015-09-27-08-41-43.png\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– As you were working on the series, how did you think about how you were going to portray the work?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>What do you mean?<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada:</strong> We went a little here and a little there. At the beginning of the scenario stage, there were discussions about putting more gag-type elements in it.<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>Definitely. By comparison, the novel is more a pure story, right? But the broadcast time was one where the people watching were late night anime fans, so I thought about making it have a more manga-type tempo in favor of them. Eventually, we didn’t go that route, but the storyboards for episode 2, which I drew, may have the most manga-type comical gags portrayed. (laughs) When you compare it to the first episode, the tempo definitely feels different. The reason is that the beginning feels more like trial and error still but as the episodes progress, the feeling solidifies into one tempo as well.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada:</strong> In the novel, Kumiko’s personality is very charming, but she’s a type that isn’t the general anime character. She’s so ordinary feeling; not at all like you’d picture a heroine being. She started to play music because her older sister played it, she worries over the flavor of the ice cream she bought afterwards, and so on. (laughs) If we depicted Kumiko, she’d feel a bit out of place as a character in an anime. But because of that, this was a very fun challenging production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/006cropped.jpg\" /></div><br />\r\nOne page of Ishihara’s storyboards for episode 2<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>– She certainly doesn’t feel like she’s the protagonist in an anime.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>Furthermore, she goes along with the flow, but she’s at the core of the story. One question was how we can bring that out in anime-form.<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>I’d say her outward appearance is also a bit low on the range of late night anime heroines. But when she’s with the other three girls, her height on that range is her tallest point. To comment on what Yamada said earlier, an ordinary protagonist would be a prodigy player or be absolutely awful, but Kumiko plays her euphonium reasonably well. It’s rare to see that type of protagonist for an anime character.<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>Actually, there is a real person I modeled Kumiko from. Since she was tall as well, I was pulled by that image of her. Of the other characters, Sapphire also was modeled after someone. The bloody hands incident was an episode that happened entirely in reality.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Takeda-san, what was the process for how you put Kumiko as a protagonist character?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>After I wrote my debut work, “Today, We Breathed Together,” (published in the Takarajimasha Bunko) my editor asked me “what would you like to write about next?” I told them that I wanted to write about an ordinary girl in a concert band and their first response was that it was too ordinary. (laughs) However, I wanted to capture the insides of the people there rather than merely depict the ups-and-downs of club activities. I consciously kept that balance between the two as I wrote and eventually, it felt like Kumiko’s current personality came out. She became the kind of girl you see around who has that strong will of a protagonist and is still able to be recalled in someone’s mind.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Was it also a difficult part to portray a too ordinary protagonist in an anime?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara:</strong> It was part of it. For novels, readers have the ability to stick their own kind of love onto the protagonist, but it’s difficult to make anime in that first-person setting. The standard is to get involved in fun things with a protagonist-seeming protagonist in anime. On the other hand, there are group setting styles from the past that have their own charm by depicting each protagonist one-at-a-time like “Two Years’ Vacation.”<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda:</strong> I love that style. When you combine various types of personalities and ways of thinking and not just one, it gradually settles together like a puzzle you can’t quite piece together at first. Each girl has their own traits and when their mutual traits meet, it starts a chemical reaction of entertaining moments. If one girl doesn’t move a certain way, then another girl with a different personality can cover for her. It’s really fun to depict relationships like that. I’m thinking that I’m a reader wanting to constantly watch over them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/euphobd12.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– After depicting things in the anime, were there any things that you became conscious about?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>With it being a 1-cour 13 episode show instead of a film, there’s no practical turning point scene as the episodes go on one-by-one. I thought for a while about various locations to put one in the series. Though we were to divide the novel into 13 episodes from the beginning, I was re-arranging and fine-tuning the contents until the final episode was finished.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>That reminds me, at the first scenario meeting, I clearly remember you and series composer (Jukki) Hanada-san saying “let’s end the first episode with Kumiko kicking Shuichi in the back.”<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>Eventually, that didn’t happen.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>That’s right. I believe you two shook on it, said farewell, and then at the next meeting it was “let’s think about that again.” What happened there? (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>The first episode itself has to have a turning point and so ending with Kumiko talking to Shuichi felt a bit lacking in that aspect. Due to that, as we were inserting the flashback scene for the middle school concert, we decided to use that flashback scheme for every episode as well. Incidentally, the original ** in episode 1 was for people to sense that the school song was being played poorly as a link to that concert, but the audience wouldn’t know what the school song for North Uji High was. Thus we thought about how to convey that clumsy playing. Since we wanted to have an entertaining song, we put in the theme from “Abarenbou Shogun.”<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>That was an incredibly entertaining moment. (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara:</strong> Modern anime end the first episode with properly raising a question to be answered. The general show would move the story along to the end of our episode 3 where Taki-sensei rebukes the band’s performance by asking “What is this?” However, I thought it fit this show’s tempo to have episode 2 have the students picking their instruments. And there are a lot of works with that kind of tempo who have the protagonist as a beginner. In that instance, Hazuki saved us. With her there, adding a subplot where she previously bought the wrong mouthpiece was a plus to the story. Both I personally, and the likely large number of viewers, with no knowledge of concert band, would purchase the wrong mouthpiece because we had no idea it was wrong. That fundamental mistake would continue to add up bit-by-bit and feel entertaining.<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>Sapphire was enjoyable as well with her slightly “old man” elements and her knowledge of music.<br />\r\nYamada: She’s the type of girl who would cite sayings by musicians, so basically we depicted her as Joe Strummer. (laughs) Thanks to that, we were able to improve the scenario to have her move around more and bring out more of her charm from the novel.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Takeda-san, what were your impressions as you read the anime scenario?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Takeda:</strong> As I read it, I felt “so you can make an anime like this.” The contents were so enjoyable. I was surprised at Sapphire-chan’s proper Japanese (Note: While all the characters in the novel except Kumiko speak with the Kansaiben dialect, Saphire really uses it.) and her interest in Tuba-kun. (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada:</strong> That mascot has the “just right” feeling to put the euphonium in the shadow of a tuba. When I was a child, we would collect “Sylvania Families,” but the series with musical instruments had a tuba included, but not a euphonium. I really remembered it and felt that we could use it as a technique to convey how minor the euphonium is.<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara:</strong> Did you know what a euphonium is?<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>Yes I did. My older sister played one. When she explained instruments to me, she said “It’s a small tuba” and “There’s a lot of tuba merchandise but…..” and her depressed mood is an image that remained with me. (laughs) Eupho-kun has a different facial expression than Tuba-kun; one that matches Kumiko, and is cute too. As I was creating the goods for inside the show, I thought about how to add the character’s charms.<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>Horn-chan is also cute.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>There’s also Sax-kun, but Eupho-kun recently came out. (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>It’d be funny to create a UFO-themed Eupho-kun design. (laughs) Either way, I truly feel thankful these goods were made.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/euphobd16.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Wanting to depict fellowship greater than love</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– The characters’ distance is a bit different than in the novel. How did you think about that range?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>Reina, in the early stages, would touch Kumiko, like point point, during the entire conversation.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>Additionally, we really paid attention to the imagery paying attention to that distance from the beginning when they weren’t close.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/euphobd14.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– It feels like the composition of their distance and the growth of Kumiko is somehow weaved or linked together.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>At the beginning, I don’t think it was this deep, but as we were producing the show, perhaps it led towards this direction. They’re different than ordinary friends. It’s like you’re friends with this amazing person and you want to try your best so that you can be on their level. To Kumiko, Reina is that presence.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>The descriptions in the novel when Kumiko sees Reina were so unbearably stimulating. Therefore, I wanted to properly depict that.<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>Thank you very much.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>I **ned to measure the amount of force so that I wouldn’t make a mistake, but it felt like the entire detailed atmosphere that I worked so hard to gather between Kumiko and Reina was just released. (laughs) On one hand it was difficult, but it was irresistibly fun to create on the other. I wanted to convey that adolescent uproar of excitation. Kumiko’s the type of girl to be looking around herself constantly and sometimes her depiction of what she sees is interesting. From her point of view, she sees Reina somewhat sensually, but that’s also a characteristic shared by girls too, right?<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda:</strong> (laughs) In almost every work, not just novels, there’s so many that put romance above fellowship, aren’t there? I wasn’t satisfied with that, so I wrote this work thinking of making fellowship above romance. It’s just as Yamada-san says, Reina is a bit sensual from Kumiko’s point of view. It’s something characteristic that a girl would sense and describe. If a man were writing it, wouldn’t it be more like a lusty wolf coming out? (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>In this world, there’s so much that doesn’t just move because of love for love’s sake.<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>Shuichi is special as well, but for Kumiko, Reina is depicted as a presence that is above him. Before Kumiko met her, he may have been her special guy, but now her relationship with Reina is eternal. It’s not just those two; that type of relationship is throughout this entire story. I wanted to show fellowship as this vastly important thing that gets cultivated by mankind depending on each other and working hard in that closed space of club activities.<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara:</strong> Relating to that description, honestly, Yamada saved us by being present. I don’t know the first thing about girl friendships or fellowships, but I can surmise from this discussion that it’s quite difficult. By all means the way guys look at girls may be depicted in stereotypes. While there is a portion of this work that feels like the processed view guys see, it was important to escape away from that stereotyping.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>There were some points that Ishihara-san felt he couldn’t grasp. Therefore, I worked as the series director so that not only could I provide a feminine intuition for the work, but I could provide another way of thinking for portions that he was able to grasp. Listening to him is also important as well.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Were your conversations grounded on Takeda-sensei’s experiences?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Takeda:</strong> I previously played in a concert band, so I included that experience. There are a lot of novels about concert band with flashbacks or written from the point of view of an instructor, but how many would want to read a story depicted from the point of view of a real student? Since I was able to write from a new point of someone who hasn’t lost her love of it, I was able to write freely while weaving and mixing in my own experiences. (laughs)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/euphobd11.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Was that image shared when the anime was being made?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>As the setting was in a location near our studios that we know quite well, we talked about wanting to try to make it feel like on-the-spot filming. I was obsessed over the camerawork while making sure that the background and layout of the screen felt like it was from a real camera.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>The locals were surprised. Uji is Uji, but to have North Uji as the setting surprised people that we would go that far to depict it as such. (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda:</strong> I had a moment with my editor when I told them about the setting being in North Uji. It was a kind of “maybe we should put in an episode about green tea” moment. (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>That’s so true. For my screen layout image, I thought it might be better to have the space seem more masculine despite there being girls in the room since there are so many girls in the club. If we did that, we could use stronger colors in the backgrounds.<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>My ideal backgrounds for this production would not feel like they were taken by a digital camera, but processed like how Kodak film used to be. Older film has somewhat narrow latitude (the rate of light exposure), so the contrast is strong and shadowy parts properly sink into the image. As I was saying that to her, Yamada replies “wouldn’t it be better to have the background hues seem more masculine.” Though Yamada and I both love film, the amount of viewers who would support us who love it is unknown, but we went that course anyways. Additionally, there’s a self-documentary atmosphere feeling as well. While it has the quality of a special about concert bands, we very skillfully chased after the appearance so it would have a feeling of a documentary as well. (laughs)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/euphobd06.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Can you give a concrete way of how a documentary would be shown?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>The camera is from a third person point of view. It’s not from one particular character’s point of view; instead it feels like there’s a cameraman chasing after the subjects. There are still some cuts of that left in where I said “I don’t dislike this style” like in the characters being introduced again in the fourth episode.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Yamada-san, was there any other proposals that you suggested for this show?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>For this show, there were a lot of times that we would just say “that’s right” in agreement for something in contrast to disagreeing with each other. Each person has their way of directing, so there were some points of disagreement with the way to use the camera, but the screen layouts we each wanted were similar.<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>I love cameras, so I’m very perceptive when it comes to depth of field or the way to use aperture. We could use soft focus to make the subject stand out more so they would be more beautiful, or we would obscure the background like a gravure photo shot so that the subject would stand out and still be beautiful. I would control for that kind of difference when creating a screen.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada:</strong> Sometimes that can be used to depict their psychological state besides how beautiful the subject is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/euphobd02.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– It felt like the scene where the girls are waiting for the walk light to turn green in episode 1 was very impressive photography.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>That’s right. It might sound bad to say, but we intentionally blurred the screen. Recently, TV shows and digital cameras are incredibly clear and pretty, but reality is not like that. From our point of view, the background isn’t so clear; it’s a more blurred point of view right? Older film styles let you experience that kind of reality.<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>It definitely felt like I was watching a movie. It didn’t feel like so-called modern anime; it felt more like the characters were really living in the real world. Coupled with the performances by the seijyu, the show always penetrates with that beautifully feeling of reality.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>We also used a similar effect in the scene with the sakura tree rows. I asked to film it with a lens similar to how a bad milk bottle would look. Originally, Ishihara-san is the director, but he asked me to draw the storyboards for the first episode, so I was very worried. But when I see Kumiko’s standpoint and think back about it after later events, that sakura tree row scene image comes to mind as a symbol of where she was. I depicted it as Kumiko wondering how long they’ll be remembered while mingling in a guardian’s point of view. Furthermore, I wanted it to be burned into her swirling heart, so I made it feel more like film.<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>It’s generally associated with a simple Photoshop where you gradually remove the detail, but the so-called 2-line boke can be used sometimes when you want something to appear as if you have a bad lens.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada:</strong> That shaded-off feeling looks magnificent like in the scene where Midori’s waiting at the station in the final episode. I love that representation from the director of photography (Kazuya) Takao-san. He’s able to process images to create a very good creation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/002cropped.jpg\" /></div><br />\r\nOne page of Yamada’s episode 1 storyboards<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Takeda-sensei, was there any scenes that you wanted to see at the time the anime was determined?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Takeda:</strong> I looked forward to seeing the climbing of Mt. Daikichi. Also, while I had a lot of expectations for the show, I watched it with fresh feelings much like an ordinary viewer.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– The direction for that felt so detailed. For example, the way the water flew was very deliberate.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>For an example, if we were to overlap a pretty flower over a girl, it would appear to be more beautiful than the girl, wouldn’t it? We aimed to have a similar effect here.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>Directing is psychological battling. Therefore, one of the points where you show your craft is how much you unintentionally move things around to a point where you affect the feelings of the viewers. For that reason, you study daily and keep lots of things secret. (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>Is that so?<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>Yes. I think I’ve said a bit too much today, so I’m stopping there. (laughs)<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Presenting musical instruments with a great deal of unknowns</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Let’s look back at how you portrayed wind music since it’s one of the themes of this show.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>From before we started work on production, we, as novices, underwent various forms of preventions to guard for unforeseen errors in handling or playing of musical instruments. As you’d imagine, we had quite a bit of them. (laughs) Our contrabass stand would inevitably start to lean down on the rightward side when it was on its stand for example. The reason why is because the right side would disengage once we set the sound post onto the pillar supporting it, and so it’d lean down on the right. We had no idea it would do that, did we? (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada:</strong> Similarly, when we were told the keynote for our horn was wrong, I immediately went into a panic without immediately understanding what they said. (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara:</strong> We first drew the tuba with its tuning pipe closed too. But during performances, we were able to make alterations to progress somewhat normally.<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>I can feel your obsessions from hearing you talk about them. (laughs) Additionally, there’s a lot of re-occurring parts that would surprise you.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>Also, there was a girl who would play the trombone in our studio who said “When I played in concerts, I would close the tuning pipe and intentionally sound different during tuning.” (laughs) After she said that and I replied “hmm, that so,” I quickly went back to correct her work.<br />\r\n<strong>All:</strong> (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada:</strong> I was so nervous every time we would bring in experienced musicians for what they would correct. (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>But it helped us tremendously to being them to our studio.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/euphobd03.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Do you have any memories of how you were able to handle the highly energetic performance scenes?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>You can’t run away from them.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>That’s right. It may be the charm of this production, but our staff would research how each instrument would perform during those performances. They would try to convey things like the weight of each piston in their drawing.<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>That is amazing.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>It’s worth doing that to give this work credit. From the very beginning, Kyoto Animation as a company has pursued finely detailed expressions. Everyone always carries with them that feeling to always do more for a production.<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>It’s tough work, but it helps you clearly present what you’ve sought out. For example, if I were to depict an overhead spaceship, all I would have to go on is my imagination, right? But musical instruments have form and a way to play them that you have to clearly understand.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada:</strong> It may seem like you do whatever you can to make the image look better, but it also helps make the portions excluding music with universal human relations come together easier too.<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>While I was re-reading the novel, I thought about how the beginning performance and the SunFest performance would look. In the story itself, I had to limit the tale to the characters mentioned or else it would get too confusing, but you constructed settings for all the members of the band. (laughs) I was astonished that you would go so far to determine parts and names for everyone.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>That reminds me, when I asked you about the mysterious step for SunFest, you replied that it’s “A certain samba.” (laughs) As I was conveying it to the episode director (Ichirou) Miyoshi-san, it got a bit entertaining.<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>If it was an ordinary production, the animator would want to stop drawing pictures as soon as possible.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada:</strong> Miyoshi-san is the kind who would resolutely take it on as a challenge. At the time we would decide to give him certain episodes, he’d do a determined pose. At the same time, he might be increasing his resolve not to quit on it. (laughs)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/euphobd15.jpg\" /></div><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Takeda-san, going through the whole show, what scene is your most memorable?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>The performance scene with Kumiko and Reina on Mt. Daikichi in episode 8. In the novel, I didn’t insert musical instruments to link the two girls, but I was moved more by the anime scene. Also, the visuals were immensely beautiful.<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara: </strong>There were a lot of circumstances where we refined the musical performances in the novel. When we had an opinion that an entertaining performance would fit the anime we tried to insert them as much as possible like the performance of the three girls playing “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” in episode 6 or the duet with Kumiko and Reina in episode 8.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>We included episodes 6 and 8 as episodes from the short story collection. Since the short story collection would be announced during the real-time production of the anime, we actively moved to mix in the episodes during the storyboarding phase. Actually, it felt really good to include the portrayal of Hazuki’s unrequited love in episode 8.<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda:</strong> I’m glad I wrote it. (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>Ishihara-san and I were glad when Chikao Takigawa showed up.<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>I borrowed the names that were attached to them in the anime when writing the story where the guys get together.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>It felt like we were writing an exchange diary as we were working on the anime and then the novels were announced. I would learn that Taki-sensei likes coffee milk and then it’d show up in your writing. (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>Right. It was very fun.<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara:</strong> I’ve wanted to ask Takeda-sensei something. The first novel contains elements that affect the second and third novels. Did you include them from the beginning to write a sequel?<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>I included them feeling “If I write one, then that’ll be good.” Also, I included meaningful overcoming reluctance scenes because I think stories that resolve things up very clearly are quite nice. Since I was pursuing realism for the first novel, Asuka became this mysterious upperclassman who thinks about various things and that aspect gave weight to her character image. If the novel and anime clearly explained why you don’t know a lot about her, then she wouldn’t be that realistic mysterious upperclassman, would she? (laughs)<br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara:</strong> Along with that way of thinking and what I mentioned earlier about photography, we purposely would use an unclear lens to bring that feeling closer to the viewer. Our thoughts were that it would strengthen that realistic feeling to not bring everything in focus clearly.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>– Please give a message to all the fans about your thoughts that were affected by this work.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ishihara:</strong> I’ve made shows with high school protagonists many times now, but I learned a lot from this work since it was my first time using a concert band as a stage. It’s been a fun production year. I can’t say something profound like it was slowly reliving my high school days all over again but, through the frantic wrestling with this work, I was able to experience something valuable such as that frantic perseverance I felt during that time.<br />\r\n<strong>Yamada: </strong>This work is something similar to taking all the feelings of Takeda-sensei, the staff, and everyone who watched and putting them into one mass eruption. With all that power pushing me forward, I was able to firm my heart and persist in depicting the strong emotions of adolescence. During the various forms of production, it was troubling, but looking back on it, it was quite fun……<br />\r\n<strong>Takeda: </strong>Being able to have a work animated like this feels like I won the lottery. (laughs) Minutely depicting the depths of wind music, bringing each and every character into reality, and furthermore diligently scraping the novel for all information, I’m thankful for everything. Furthermore, I was blessed with the chance to write sequels and safely conclude my work. All of it was a blessing I never knew once it was set to be animated. I truly thank you all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br

/>\r\n<strong>石原：</strong>没错。相比之下，小说更多的是一个纯粹的故事，对吧？但放送时间来说，观众都是深夜动画的粉丝，所以我认为要让故事节奏更接近漫画以支持他们（看下去）。最终，我们没有走那条路，但我画的第2话的分镜也许（是全篇）有最多漫画式搞笑描绘（的一话）。（笑）当你把它同第一话比较时，肯定会感到节奏不一样。因为开始更像是仍在试错，但随着话数增加，故事逐渐稳定成一个节奏<br />\r\n<strong>山田：</strong>小说中，久美子的性格非常有魅力，但她又不是一般意义上的动画角色类型。她给人感觉太普通了，完全不像你要去描绘的是一个女主角。她开始玩音乐是因为她的姐姐也在玩，她担心买了的冰淇淋的味道，等等。（大笑）如果让我们形容久美子，她让人感觉她在一部动画里显得格格不入。但正因为这样，这次制作非常有趣，而且富有挑战性。<br />\r\n<br

/>\r\n<strong>石原</strong>：我想说的是她的外表相较（其他）深夜动画的女主也略有差距。但当她和其他三个女生在一起时，在这个范围内她的身高就是她最大的特点。说一下山田刚刚的发言，一个常见的主角要么是天才要么完全一塌糊涂，但久美子上低音号吹的还可以。这种类型在动画主角中非常少见<br />\r\n<strong>武田</strong>：实际上，久美子是有真人原型的。因为她也很高，所以我带入了她的形象。其他角色的话，小绿也是以某个人为模版的。手指流血的意外就是最近现实里发生过的一幕<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>–武田桑，（决定）把久美子作为主角，这个过程是怎样的呢？</strong><br />\r\n<strong>武田</strong>：在完成我的出道作“今天我们一起呼吸”（宝岛社文库揭载）后，我的编辑问我“接下来你想写什么？”我告诉他们，我想写乐队中的一个普通女生，他们第一反应是，这太普通了。（笑）但是，我想捕捉乐队中人们的内心世界而不仅仅是描绘波澜起伏的社团活动。我在写作时有意识地保持二者间的平衡，最终就有了久美子现在的个性。她成为了那种你在周围能够见到的女生，拥有很强的主角光环，又让人觉得似曾相识<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>-在动画中描写一个太过普通的主角是不是也是一件很难的事情？</strong><br />\r\n<strong>石原：</strong>一定程度上是的。对小说来说，读者能够（由于自身带入）对主角情有独钟，但用这种第一人称视角去做动画就非常困难。在动画中，标准是让看起来像是主角的主角遇到（一系列）有意思的事情。另一个方面来讲，过去有一类群像设定风格，一次只描绘其中一个主角，从而使其（显得）各有魅力，就像《十五少年漂流记》那样（注：《十五少年漂流记》，法国作家儒勒·凡尔纳作品，发表于1888年。书名直译为《两年假期》）<br />\r\n<strong>武田：</strong>我喜欢那种风格。当你将各种各样而非仅仅一种性格和思考方式结合在一起之后，它们就逐渐组合在一起，如同无法一开始就拼凑在一起的拼图一样。每个女孩都有她自己独特的特点，当她们彼此的特点相遇到一起时，就开始产生一种有趣的化学反应。如果一个女孩不按照某种方式行事，那么另外一个有着不同个性的女孩可以弥补她。描绘那样的关系真的非常有趣。我想，作为一个读者的话，我会希望不断地关注着她们<br

17:41","message":"<strong>-在动画里描绘这些事情之后，有什么东西是你们才意识到的吗？</strong><br />\r\n<strong>石原：</strong>因为它是部一季13话的动画而非电影，在一话一话发展下去的情况下不会出现实际的转折场景。关于不同的地点（如何）安排进作品中我思考了一段时间。虽然一开始我们就打算把小说分成13话，但直到最后一话完成前我还在重新安排和修改完善内容<br />\r\n<strong>山田：</strong>这倒提醒了我，在第一次脚本会议上，我清楚地记得你和系列构成（花田）说“让我们以久美子一脚踢在秀一背上作为第一话的结局吧。”<br />\r\n<strong>石原：</strong>最后并没有出现就是了<br />\r\n<strong>山田：</strong>没错。我相信你俩在这点上达成了共识，然后相互道别。结果下一次会议上又是“让我们重新考虑一下吧”那里发生了什么？（笑）<br />\r\n<strong>石原：</strong>第一话本身需要一个转折点，所以以久美子和秀一谈话作为结尾的话从某一方面来讲少了点什么。因此，当我们插入中学演奏会的倒叙场景时，我们决定每话也都采用倒叙的设计（注：指每话开篇的前情回顾）。顺带一提，第一话最初的计划是通过演奏糟糕的校歌来让人感受到和演奏会的关联，但是观众根本不知道北宇治的校歌是什么样的。所以我们考虑如何表现那种拙劣的演奏。因为我们希望有一首很有趣的曲子，所以就用了“暴坊将军”的主题曲<br />\r\n<strong>武田：</strong>那个场景真的太有意思了（笑）<br />\r\n<strong>石原：</strong>现今的动画通常以恰当地提出一个待解决的问题作为第一话的结尾。一般的作品（的话）会将故事延续到我们第三话结尾泷老师用“这是什么？”来责备乐队的演奏（这一场景）作为（第一话的）结尾。但是，我认为在第二话加入让学生们选择乐器（的情节）会比较符合这部作品的节奏，而且主角是新手的大量作品也都采用了这样的节奏。在那种情况下，叶月救了我们。有她在那里，加入一段她之前买错了号嘴的陪衬情节成为故事的加分项。包括我个人在内，也像很多观众一样，对于乐队一无所知，就会买错号嘴，因为我们不知道那是错的。这种浅显的错误会一点点累加起来，感觉非常有趣 <br />\r\n<strong>武田：</strong>小绿和她那轻微的“老手”元素以及关于音乐的知识也非常有意思<br />\r\n<strong>山田：</strong>她是那种会引用音乐家语录类的女孩儿，所以基本上我们把她描绘成了Joe Strummer。（笑）（注：Joe Strummer，传奇朋克摇滚乐队the Clash的歌手，吉他手以及歌曲作者，生于政治世家，很多歌曲以政治为题材，有浓烈的左派思想，上世纪70年代末期到80年代叱咤英伦乐坛，掀起朋克浪潮）感谢这一点，我们可以改进剧本，让她更加活跃，表现出比小说中更大的魅力<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>-武田桑，当你读到动画剧本的时候你的印象是什么？</strong><br />\r\n<strong>武田：</strong>当我读的时候，我觉得“像这样的动画可以做”。内容非常有趣。我对小绿标准的日文（注：小说中除久美子之外所有角色均是关西腔，特别是小绿）以及她对大号君的兴趣感到很惊讶。（笑）<br />\r\n<strong>山田：</strong>那个吉祥物给人“刚刚好”让悠风号位于大号阴影之下的感觉。在我还是个孩子的时候，我们会收集“森贝儿家族”（注：森贝儿家族，著名儿童玩具品牌，以‘自然’’‘家族’‘爱’为主题，塑造各种栩栩如生的动物玩偶，造型精巧的房子，家具等），但那个系列中的乐器有大号却没有悠风号。我记的非常清楚，并且感觉我们可以利用这个作为手段来表现悠风号到底多么的稀有<br />\r\n<strong>石原：</strong>你知道悠风号是什么吗？<br />\r\n<strong>山田：</strong>没错，我知道。我姐姐就是吹这个的。当她向我解释这种乐器的时候，她说“是小一点的大号”以及“有很多大号的商品但是……（却没有悠风号的）”她情绪低沉的样子留在了我记忆中。（笑）悠风号君面部表情跟大号君不同，和久美子相匹配，而且也很可爱。在我创作这部动画里那些商品时，我也有考虑如何增加角色的魅力<br />\r\n<strong>武田：</strong>小号酱也很可爱<br />\r\n<strong>山田：</strong>还有萨克斯君，但悠风号君最近才推出。（笑）<br />\r\n<strong>武田：</strong>创造一个UFO主题的悠风号君很有意思。（笑）不管怎么说，这些商品能够做出来真的非常非常感谢<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div

/>\r\n<strong>-感觉她们之间的距离变化和久美子的成长在某种程度上被编织和串联在一起了</strong><br />\r\n<strong>石原：</strong>一开始，我没有考虑（要融合）这么深，但在我们制作的过程中，可能它（自然而然的）导向了这一方向。她们不同于普通意义上的朋友。就像是你同这样一个令人惊羡的人是朋友，而你试图尽力（追赶）从而达到她所在的高度。对久美子来说，丽奈就是那样的存在<br />\r\n<strong>山田：</strong>在小说中，对久美子看见丽奈时的描写是令人感到（久美子受到）难以言喻的刺激的。因此，我想恰当地（将这一点）描绘出来<br />\r\n<strong>武田：</strong>非常感谢<br />\r\n<strong>山田：</strong>我（本来）准备估量一下（这一刺激）力度的量，以免出错，但似乎我辛苦努力积聚起来的久美子和丽奈间充满细节的气氛都被（一股脑）释放了出来。（笑）一方面来讲，这是很困难的，但从另一方面看，这一创作的乐趣是难以抗拒的。我想传达是一种令人激动的青春期时的悸动。久美子是那种总是不停观察着自身周围类型的女孩儿，有时她对她所见的事物的描述非常有趣。从她的视角来讲，她所见的丽奈显得有一点色情，但这也是女生所共有的一种特质，不是吗？<br />\r\n<strong>武田：</strong>（笑）不止是小说，在几乎所有作品中，都是爱情高于友情，不是吗？我对此并不满意，所以我写这部作品时，想要让友情高于爱情。就像山田桑说的，丽奈从久美子视角来看显得有些色情。这是女生会感受并形容出来的某种特质。如果是一位男性来描写这一点，表现出来的不更像是一头荷尔蒙旺盛的狼么？（笑）<br />\r\n<strong>山田：</strong>在这个世界上，有非常多因为爱的缘故却并不仅仅是因为爱情而感动的事物<br />\r\n<strong>武田：</strong>就是说，秀一也是特别的，但对久美子来说，丽奈被描写成高于秀一的存在。在这之后，秀一有不再是特别的异性的可能性，但久美子和丽奈的关系是不变的。不仅仅是这两个人，这种关系贯穿于整个故事中。我想表现，友谊，这一人类所培养出的极其重要事物，是依靠彼此（才得以发展）并且在团体活动这一封闭空间中发挥着重要作用<br />\r\n<strong>石原：</strong>关于那个描写，诚实的讲，山田（能够）在现场真是救了我们。我不知道女孩之间友情或者友谊的首要事情是什么，但我从这个讨论中可以猜测的到（准确描绘出）这一点是非常困难的。男性看待女孩的角度在各种意义上会较为刻板老套。然而这部作品的部分（情节）看起来正像是（通过）男性视角加工后所见的，所以逃离这种刻板印象是非常重要的<br />\r\n<strong>山田：</strong>有一些点石原桑感觉他抓不住。因此，作为系列演出，我的工作不仅仅是为作品提供女性的直觉，还要为他能够抓住的部分提供另外一种思路。听他讲（他的想法）也很重要<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>-你们的对话都是基于武田老师的经历吗？</strong><br />\r\n<strong>武田：</strong>我之前曾经参加过一个乐团，所以我（说的话）中包含有那些经历。有大量关于乐队的小说是从指导者视角去回忆或者描写的，但有多少人愿意去读一个从真正的学生视角进行描述的故事呢？因为我要从一个还没有对此丧失热爱之情的人的新视角去描写，所以我可以自由地编织和糅合我自己的经历在里面。（笑）<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div
